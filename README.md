# ALS-Aging Genetic Interaction Analysis Tool

## Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with age as its primary risk factor. The interplay between age-related genetic changes and the ALS genetic background is hypothesized to accelerate disease pathology. Analyzing differential gene expression data to uncover genes impacted by aging and ALS provides critical insights into this interaction. However, existing tools often require significant manual effort and lack tailored functionalities for comparing aging-related genes with ALS-associated genes.

To address this gap, I propose the development of a Python-based tool that processes transcriptomics data (e.g., BAM files) and clinical metadata or published differential expression datasets. This tool will extract differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on user-defined thresholds and compare aging-related DEGs with ALS-specific DEGs. The output will include a comprehensive list of intersecting genes with detailed dissection.

## Overview of the Tool

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Accepts BAM files containing transcriptomics data of patient motor cortex samples and a corresponding clinical metadata file (CSV).
   - Alternatively, accepts pre-processed differential expression datasets in Excel format.

2. **Differential Expression Analysis:**
   - For BAM and clinical data inputs:
     - Performs differential expression analysis to generate a DEG table.
     - Allows users to define parameters such as p-value and log2 fold change (Log2FC) thresholds for DEG identification.
   - For pre-processed Excel inputs:
     - Filters the data based on the user-provided parameters to identify DEGs.

3. **Gene Comparison:**
   - Compares aging-related DEGs with ALS-associated DEGs.
   - Identifies intersecting genes and highlights those unique to either dataset.
   - Outputs detailed gene lists for further analysis.

4. **Output:**
   - Generates a report summarizing:
     - Aging DEGs, ALS DEGs, and their intersections.
     - Gene-specific details (e.g., expression levels, statistical significance).
   - Exports results in CSV or Excel formats for downstream use.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Required Libraries:**
   - Install Python libraries for the necessary functionalities:
     - RNA-seq processing: `HTSeq`, `pysam`
     - Statistical analysis: `scipy`, `statsmodels`
     - Data manipulation: `pandas`
     - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

2. **Workflow:**
   - **BAM Processing:**
     - Use `pysam` to process BAM files and extract read counts.
     - Normalize counts and perform DEG analysis using `statsmodels`.
   - **Data Filtering:**
     - Apply user-defined thresholds for p-value and Log2FC to identify significant DEGs.
   - **Gene Comparison:**
     - Compare aging-related genes with ALS-related genes using `pandas`.
   - **Visualization:**
     - Plot Venn diagrams and heatmaps to visualize DEG intersections and unique genes.
   - **Export:**
     - Save results as CSV or Excel files.

3. **Execution:**
   - Launch the script from the command line:
     - For BAM inputs: `python script.py --bam <bam_file> --csv <clinical_data.csv>`
     - For Excel inputs: `python script.py --excel <differential_expression.xlsx>`
   - Specify thresholds using flags: `--p_value <value>`, `--log2fc <value>`.

## Conclusion
This Python tool bridges a gap in ALS and aging-related research by providing an efficient, user-friendly solution for differential gene expression analysis and comparison. By automating data processing, analysis, and visualization, the tool enables researchers to identify key intersecting genes and generate hypotheses for further experimental validation.

## Future Directions

- Incorporate pathway analysis tools to contextualize intersecting genes within biological processes.
- Extend compatibility to additional input formats (e.g., FASTQ files).
- Enable integration with public databases for automated annotation of gene functions.
